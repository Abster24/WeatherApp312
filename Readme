This is my Semester Project for CSIS 312-001. This is meant to be a weather app, using Weatherstack API. 

THIS PROJECT IS ONLY OPEN TO CONTRIBUTIONS FROM OTHER STUDENTS IN THE SAME CLASS.

You must have JavaFX and SceneBuilder installed on your machine to run this code. You will also have to obtain your own API Key from Weatherstack. 
FOR SECURITY PURPOSES DO NOT PUBLISH YOUR API KEY.

UPDATES

12/2/24 (AbSny) - Currently the project is in beginning stages. After experimenting with okhttp3, the app has been connected to Weatherstack,
a basic ui has been created in JavaFX, and the user can enter a city name and receive the current temperature and weather of the location. 
  Planned Updates: 
      1. Allow User to store preferred locations that automatically load when app is started (Begun work with MySql).
      2. Build out UI to look more professional.
      3. Allow user to specify zip code or state in order to ensure they receive the right information
